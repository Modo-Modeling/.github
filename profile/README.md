## What is Borderless Gaming?

**Borderless Gaming** is a powerful and versatile software solution designed to transform traditional fullscreen or windowed games into a seamless **borderless windowed mode**. This innovative approach eliminates the common frustrations associated with fullscreen gaming, such as alt-tab delays, screen flickering, and application crashes. By running your favorite games in a borderless window, you can enjoy uninterrupted multitasking, whether you're responding to messages, browsing the web, or managing streaming software.

The software is especially beneficial for streamers and content creators who need to switch between applications frequently without disrupting their gameplay or broadcast. It ensures that your game remains active and visible, even when other windows are in focus. Borderless Gaming is compatible with a vast library of PC games, including popular titles like **Minecraft**, **Metro Exodus**, **Cyberpunk 2077**, and many others. Its ability to create a pseudo-fullscreen experience means you get the visual immersion of fullscreen mode with the convenience and stability of a window.

Built as an open-source project, Borderless Gaming is freely available and continuously improved by a dedicated community of developers and gamers. It’s a lightweight, efficient tool that requires minimal system resources, making it suitable for both high-end gaming rigs and older hardware. With support for Windows 10 and Windows 11, it’s the go-to solution for anyone looking to optimize their gaming setup for productivity and performance.
